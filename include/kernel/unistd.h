/*
 In the C and C++ programming languages, unistd.h is the name 
 of the header file that provides access to the POSIX 
 operating system API. It is defined by the POSIX.1 standard, 
 the base of the Single Unix Specification, and should therefore 
 be available in any conforming (or quasi-conforming) 
 operating system/compiler (all official versions of UNIX, 
 including macOS, Linux, etc.).
 
 On Unix-like systems, the interface defined by unistd.h is 
 typically made up largely of system call wrapper functions 
 such as fork, pipe and I/O primitives (read, write, close, etc.).
