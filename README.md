Gramado Operating System


The kernel starts in Graphic Mode 800x600x24.
I'm working to support GRUB boot loader. 
I need to load the kernel and some other files. 
Maybe you can help me with this thing.


/init    = init application
/kernel  = kernel
/shell   = shell application 
/taskman = taskman application
