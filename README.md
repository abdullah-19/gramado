Gramado Operating System


The kernel starts in Graphic Mode 800x600x24.
I'm working to support GRUB boot loader. 
I need to load the kernel and some other files. 
Maybe you can help me with this thing.


<br>/init    = init application
<br>/kernel  = kernel
<br>/shell   = shell application 
<br>/taskman = taskman application
